# HydroPulse ðŸ’§âš¡

**Software-Only Municipal Hydraulic Digital Twin for Pipe Burst Triangulation**
*Lakshya 2026 @ SJBIT Bengaluru Â· Track 02: Smart and Sustainable Future*

## 1. Project Overview

HydroPulse is a software-only digital twin of Bengaluru's municipal water distribution network (specifically the Kengeri ward adjacent to SJBIT). Using EPANET network modeling and US EPA WNTR (Pressure-Driven Demand with Torricelli orifice leak physics), HydroPulse continuously monitors pressure differentials across just **5 strategically placed sentinel junction sensors**.

When an underground main bursts:
1. The 5-sensor pressure-drop fingerprint is cross-referenced against a precomputed sensitivity matrix using scale-invariant cosine similarity.
2. A Stage-2 physics verification re-simulates the top 5 candidates with estimated hole areas to eliminate false positives.
3. The system pinpoints the exact leaking junction / city block.
4. Loss rate is converted to liters per minute (LPM) and equivalent BWSSB 6,000L water tankers per day.
5. An optimal valve-isolation plan is immediately computed to cut off the ruptured segment while minimizing disconnected households.

**Zero hardware required.**

## 4. Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 â€“ 3.12 (Python 3.11 recommended)
- Node.js 20 LTS & npm
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd hydropulse

# 2. Run automated setup (creates .venv, installs Python & npm dependencies)
make setup
# OR on Windows PowerShell:
# .\scripts\setup.ps1
```

### Running the Services

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start FastAPI backend (http://localhost:8000, docs at /docs)
make backend
# OR: .\scripts\run_backend.ps1

# Terminal 2: Start Vite frontend dashboard (http://localhost:5173)
make frontend
# OR: .\scripts\run_frontend.ps1
```

## 6. Testing, Production Deployment & Demo Insurance

```bash
# Run full backend, Part 2, deployment readiness, and contract test suites
make test

# Run API smoke test (v1.0 + v1.1 endpoints) against running backend
make smoke

# Regenerate mock fixtures for frontend
make fixtures

# Snapshot live backend responses into mock fixtures for offline demo insurance
make snapshot
```

For production Linux setup, environment variables (`.env.example`), security hardening, OpenRouter configuration, and Docker container packaging, see **[`DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **CORS Errors**: Always access the UI via `http://localhost:5173` (or configure `HYDROPULSE_CORS_ORIGINS` in production).
- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure port 8000 (backend) and 5173 (frontend) are free before launching.
- **Offline Venue Setup**: See `docs/RUN_OF_SHOW.md` for full instructions to run HydroPulse completely offline without an internet connection.
